# GoodFortuneBank
An application that simulates a bank and its database of account-holders.
Compiled with, and uses JRE and JDK from Java ver. 16.0.2.

Unfortunately, the previous versions of this application are unavailable due to corrupted files.
I had to move the application to a new GitHub repository due to this.

TODO:
SavingsAccount needs to accrue interest.

NEEDS TO BE FIXED:
Formatting :(
